SLDF Incoming!
==============

This mod adds SLDF mechs, accompanied by an elite lance, as a rare spawn in
standard missions. They will show up infrequently in lower difficulty missions,
rising to about 1 in 4 missions at maximum difficulty. Elite pilots and tougher
lancemates add to the challenge.

Endgame high-skull missions will also be somewhat more difficult on average due
to additional basic lances which bulk out the non-SLDF list. These lances exist
to tune the odds of SLDF lances being picked by the mission, but also avoid the
weak dynamic difficulty lance spawner at difficulty 8 and above. It is possible
that some combinations of these lances may be substantially stronger than the
stock game in some missions.


Requirements
------------

This mod assumes all DLC is owned. If playing without DLC, delete the "DLCmech"
folder and do not use the optional extras.


Optional Extras
---------------

Two optional additions are included. EW_early.zip unlocks the electronic warfare
mechs to appear in missions before completing the Raven flashpoint and before
their lore appearance date. Bonus.zip contains two extra (mostly-lore-accurate)
SLDF mechs, and adds them plus the DLC SLDF mechs to the stores that contain the
base game SLDF mechs.

To use the extras, extract the zip files to the base "SLDF_incoming" mod folder.
